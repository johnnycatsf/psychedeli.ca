Very soon, I will be providing a [Diaspora](http://joindiaspora.com/) pod for semi-public use. It will be located on <http://s.psychedeli.ca/> as soon as the DNS propagates and I work out the inevitable bugs that will come with setting it up. I think the idea of an open-source social network is very progressive and, even though I know [Facebook is very committed to their "open platform" mission](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/08/facebook-open-compute-project_n_846925.html), there is still some room for improvement. I find Diaspora to be more in accordance with the world wide web's [original intent](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=long-live-the-web&page=3), that is, to provide open access to information. Diaspora respects that, and adds the ability to protect private, personally-identifying information to just the people on your own pod. Your pod can be registered to immediately by any Diaspora user, but you control all of the data that lands there (if you're the server administrator). Diaspora is more like the anti-commercial, research- and innovation-driven world wide web that _I_ grew up with.

I'll be honest, and I think others feel this way too: I'm sick of having to consistently turn off features on Facebook I don't want to use. I just find a billion emails from Facebook's notifier in my box one morning because I neglected to notice their little checkbox on the "Privacy settings" page. Can't there just be an option to turn off ALL email and SMS communication? I got the iPhone app for a reason! But I also won't sit here and trash Facebook, because as a company I think they're pretty smart. Of course it's easier to demo features to the public when you auto-enable it, but I feel that they need to do more auditing as to what pisses their users off vs. what I would consider "unobtrusive feature-pushing".

Anyway, I'm also doing this so I can prototype my patches and changes to the Diaspora codebase, as I also plan to [contribute](http://github.com/tubbo/diaspora) to their efforts at creating the world's first open social network.
