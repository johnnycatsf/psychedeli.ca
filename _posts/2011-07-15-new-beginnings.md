Well, after fighting with Typo a bunch I finally decided it was time and moved my blog to YET ANOTHER ENGINE! I think I've truly found a home this time, though.

I'm using this static site generator called [Jekyll][1]. It was written by GitHubber [Tom Preston-Werner][2]. Kudos to him for simplifying the FUCK out of blogging. It's quite easy to create a nice looking static HTML site when you're not reinventing the wheel and developing on an [application-grade web framework][3]. While I'm still a big fan of Rails for building and/or conceptualizing large-scale or complicated web projects, dealing with my personal site has been both a fun challenge and quite a hassle. I'm typically doing hurdles over other people's code, and spending a LOT of time reinventing the wheel.
