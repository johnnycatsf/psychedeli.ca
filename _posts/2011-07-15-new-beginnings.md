Well, after fighting with Typo a bunch I finally decided it was time and moved my blog to YET ANOTHER ENGINE! I think I've truly found a home this time, though.

I'm using this static site generator called [Jekyll][1]. It was written by GitHubber [Tom Preston-Werner][2]. Kudos to simplifying the fuck out of blogging, and with services
like DISQUS or Facebook comments, I can offload that task to another service and continue to do anything I want
