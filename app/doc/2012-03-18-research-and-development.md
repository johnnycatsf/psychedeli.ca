I feel like I've been posting a lot about code on this blog. It's mostly what I find myself writing about inside my text editor, but today I feel like I should change the subject a bit. I've been feverishly working on both [The Wonder Bars'][bars] debut album as well as side projects with some of my friends here in the Philadelphia electronic music scene (in its various forms). One of the most fruitful collaborations has been with [The Architech][arch], a DJ I've known about for quite a while but which Philly is just beginning to get introduced to. He was one of the core guys behind the early raves at The Vaudeville Theater, where influential rave DJs like [Brak][udachi] (before he became Udachi), [Jen Mas][jen], [DJ Venom][vnm] and [Frankie Bones][fb] performed in what seemed like uninhabitable conditions. This was all before my time, though, so if you really want to hear the full story you'll just have to come out to one of his shows and ask him yourself. He's a resident at [Propaganda @ the HeadHouse][prop] and plays the [Bangarang!][brg] monthly (and not-so-monthly rager) parties.

But enough about that. Here's what we've been working on...
