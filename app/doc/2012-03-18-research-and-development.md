I feel like I've been posting a lot about code on this blog. It's mostly what I find myself writing about inside [my text editor][subl], but today I feel like I should change the subject a bit. I've been feverishly working on both [The Wonder Bars][bars]' debut album as well as side projects with some of my friends here in the Philadelphia electronic music scene (in its various forms). One of the most fruitful collaborations has been with [The Architech][arch], a DJ I've known about for quite a while but which Philly is just beginning to get introduced to. He was one of the core guys behind the early raves at The Vaudeville Theater, where influential rave DJs like [Brak (now Udachi)][udch] and [Jen Mas][jen] performed in what seemed like uninhabitable conditions. This was all before my time, though, so if you really want to hear the full story you'll just have to come out to one of his shows and ask him yourself. He's a resident at **Propaganda** and the **Bangarang! 4th Fridays** monthly parties at The HeadHouse, and frequently plays the legendary [PEX][pex] parties, including [the most recent one at the Electric Factory][mix]. We both will be playing (separately) at [PEX Summer Festival][psf] this upcoming June.

But enough about that. Here's what we've been working on...
