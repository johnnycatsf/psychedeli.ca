# Well, for me anyways..

Creating the perfect IDE for everyone is a fool's errand. You'd have better luck creating the perfect treaty between Israel and Palestine. Everyone already has their own "style" and comfort in their editor/IDE of choice, and on top of that, the unique pieces of your project may cause you to alter your IDE.


But I want to create the perfect IDE **for me**. I have problems with every single multi-file editor I've ever picked up, back to TextPad on Windows. And don't even get me started on that absolute piece of trash I was forced to learn Java on, Eclipse. Seriously, Internet Explorer crashes less than Eclipse in the early days. For an open-source program financed by several huge corporations, that's just a fucking joke.

Right now, I use the lovely [Sublime Text 2][st] editor. With it's massive package library and limited extendability, I've gotten used to the way it works and really began enjoying

## The "Integrated" part: Fluid integration with the code, not the documentation.

The *only* reliable source of information is actually getting into the nitty-gritty business of reading source code. I never realized how much I didn't look up the source to see why a method is breaking or not behaving the way I thought it would. That is, until I began [working at my current gig][el], and dealing with the aging [ActiveMerchant][am] docs when creating the billing components for our Rails app.
