## hi

My name is **Tom**, but most people just call me
<span class="twitter-name">@tubbo</span>. This is my blog and personal site.
It's a home for my life, or lack thereof.

By day, I'm a web application developer, creating awesome software with
[Ruby](http://ruby-lang.com) and [JavaScript](http://javascript.crockford.com).

But by night, I lead my band [The Wonder Bars](http://thewonderbars.com) to almost certain death! You can 
follow our lead at <span class="twitter-name">@wonderbars</span>, Browse my 
[Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/wonderbars) [profiles](http://soundcloud.com/resnedv), or click the 
cloud icon below to hear my music. 

If you like computers and/or wizardry, I also urge you to check out my
[Github](http://github.com/tubbo) profile for all the fun software I write. I am a contributor
to the [DIASPORA*](http://github.com/diaspora/diaspora) project as well as the author of some
[lesser-known](http://github.com/tubbo/blue_velvet) [open-source](http://github.com/tubbo/dots)
[works](https://github.com/tubbo/diaspora-tagger). I try to work "in the open" as much
as possible, so that others may benefit from my either positive or negative experiences.
