# welcome to psychedeli.ca

This is my personal website and blog, where i write about all kinds of
things. Usually I know what I'm talking about. I'm mostly interested in
[making music][music] and [programming things][github], so that's what this
blog is going to be about *most* of the time. Check out the pretty links
above to subscribe to this feed, or to follow me on Twitter if you're into
that. The Facebook link above is to like my band page, which I also think
you should do if [you understand house music][house].

You may know me from being [a dictator of DIASPORA][dia],
[the lead singer in a band][band], or just as some regular old asshat
that contributed to your open-source project. Either way, somehow you found
this website unless my domain has been added to some weird spam database
somewhere...

If you want to know more about the work I've done and what I'm interested
in technology-wise, [check out my resume][resume]. My record label is also
accepting new artists right now, so [send me a demo][demo] if you want to work
together!
