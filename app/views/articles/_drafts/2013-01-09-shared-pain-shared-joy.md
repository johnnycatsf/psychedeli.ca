I'd like to start this one off with a quote by a favorite author of mine...

  Shared pain is lessened,
  Shared joy is increased.
  Thus, we refute entropy.

        - Spider Robinson

It's a great analogy for why I think frameworks are *more* secure than
building your own in-house software. Let's break it down.

## Shared pain is lessened

This is absolutely true. When a new feature is developed for Rails that
improves security, we all benefit from not having to keep the integrity
of input data in mind when developing an application. Forgetting to
clean strings is a thing of the past. And with Rails' massive community,
any time a vulnurability is discovered, it gets patched within days and
all major versions are updated.

## Shared joy is increased
