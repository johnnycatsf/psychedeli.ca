Producing, DJing and subsequently performing electronic music has
changed the way I think about composition in general. It is very
different, and in many ways *more* free, than playing with a punk
band or jazz group/jam. There are so many different ways of
producing electronic music these days, it can be challenging to find a
solution that works for you. Because of this fact, many producers have
opted to use techniques and formulas throughout their career to define
their "sound", as well as make the "hard work" job of producing easier
so you can get to the more fun, compositional part. One technique I
use, which I will talk about further in this article, is **establishing
an ensemble** for your work, and decide on a group of instruments or
sounds that you wish to use in most of your music.

## back in the day

Traditionally before sound recording became feasible, music was mostly
performed by bands of musicians, each musician filling a certain "role"
in the sound. As recording technology matured, these bands got recorded
onto vinyl or tape, and we were able to experiment with how these bands
sounded to the general public. This created a bit of a dichotomy in how
music is portrayed, there are now two "theaters" where you can experience
music: the home and the concert hall/club.
