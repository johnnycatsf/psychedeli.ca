FreeNAS has been working just awesome on my little GX270. The only problem, of course, is noise. I hope one day to upgrade it to a 4U rackmount server, the question is where will I be able to put it where it's out of the way, protected from the elements, and also in a cool, safe spot? Right now, the fileserver just sits underneath my cable box next to my television. If the speakers are up high enough you can't hear the small noise of the fan at all.
