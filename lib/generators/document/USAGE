Description:
    Generates an ActiveDocument model. The class behaves just like a
    normal Rails model, but reads its data from
    app/documents/#{model_names} instead of a database.

Example:
    rails generate active_document model_name

    This will create:
        app/documents/model_names/example.md
        app/models/model_name.rb
        test/unit/model_name.rb
        test/fixtures/model_names/example.md
