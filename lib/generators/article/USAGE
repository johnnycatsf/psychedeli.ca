Description:
    Generates a Mardown article in app/views/articles/contents,
    timestamped to today's date. You must specify a title for
    the article, which along with the timestamp will be parameterized
    and used to compose the filename of the Markdown source
    (also doubling as the article's ID)

Example:
    rails generate article 'A snappy title'

    This will create:
        app/views/articles/content/2013-01-01-a-snappy-title.md
