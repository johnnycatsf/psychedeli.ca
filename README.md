psychedelica berserk
====================

This is the source code of my blog, which is (usually) up and running on <http://psychedeli.ca>. I created the user interface in [Sass SCSS][sass] and mostly [jQuery][jq]. The content is compiled by [Jekyll][jekyll]. Included in this repo is a binary I made with [Thor][thor] called `synth` which can be run to both compress/minify the JavaScript code and generate the Jekyll site.
